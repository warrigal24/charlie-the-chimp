Solution by Garry Francis
----------------------------------------
This is a minimal solution. You'll need to EXAMINE lots of things for this solution to make sense. Some optional (but significant) commands are shown in parentheses. You can omit these once you know what to do.

(X TREE) (it looks perfect for climbing)
(CLIMB TREE) (the gorilla's blocking access to it)
(X GORILLA) (he's asleep on his back)
(WAKE GORILLA) (he grunts and continues sleeping)
GET STICK
(X IT) (you'd hate to be spanked with that)
(SPANK GORILLA) (you spank him with your hand, but he doesn't feel a thing)
(SPANK GORILLA WITH STICK) (his thick hair absorbs the blow, find a soft spot)
(PUSH GORILLA) (he won't budge, try pulling him instead)
PULL GORILLA (you expose his bum)
SLAP GORILLA WITH STICK (he wakes, but he's now angry)
U
GET VINE
(X IT) (it looks quite strong)
W
TIE VINE TO BRANCH
D
(X ORANGUTAN) (his feet almost reach top of west well at pinnacle of his swing)

(X HAY) (it's soft)

GET BANANA
(X IT) (it's a favourite food of all primates)
PUT IT IN HOLE (orangutan hops down, reaches into hole for banana & gets stuck)
PRESS BUTTON
GET BANANA
EAT IT (you're left with a banana peel)
GET ON SWING (time to get swinging)
SWING IT (your feet nearly touch the roof)
JUMP ONTO ROOF
(X SKYLIGHT) (maybe you could open it to see what's below)
OPEN SKYLIGHT

E (you jump safely onto the pile of hay)
PRESS BUTTON (someone fell down the stairs)
GET ON SWING
SWING IT
JUMP ONTO ROOF
