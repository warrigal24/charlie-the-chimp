# Charlie the Chimp

By Garry Francis

## Background

It's a beautiful day in the gorilla enclosure at Sydney's famous Taronga Park Zoo. There's only one problem. You're not a gorilla, you're a chimpanzee named Charlie. Some idiot zookeeper has mistaken you for a baby gorilla and put you in the wrong enclosure. It must be someone new, as the staff are normally very good.

Fortunately for you, the gorilla is currently asleep. You need to find your way back home to the chimpanzee enclosure before the gorilla wakes up and sits on you. Or worse!

Or maybe you'll have to wake him. That's for you to work out.

This is a traditional text adventure that was originally written for [The Next Adventure Jam](https://itch.io/jam/next-adventure-jam), 6 June to 5 July 2020.
